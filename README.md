# magicwords app

Magic words is an application that reads the contents
of a users text files. The app then creates a database
of the users content, and builds helpful statistics to
show which words are used the most.

//NOTE: I want to include a sort of weight system that
will compare words on a variety of scales--from general
definition similarity, and closeness on the synonym scale.

//NOTE: Consider more kinds of charts and statistics.
